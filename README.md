# X-O-game-in-C
The first real game I've made in C.

It's really basic as its my first project ive done that actually is a serious "game". Its all ascii based, and ive done it the only way i knew how, without any tutorials.

Its very badly optimized though, at nearly 300 lines soon, so I'll be releasing a few new features to this demo:
1. A space ran out detector
2. More optimized turns
3. Win conditions

So far, that's all. Hangman might be next, but who knows.
